            Curator and Historian
            </h3>
            <Card.Text>
            I come to the world of technology from a background as an historian of Books and Media.
            My scholarly interests range from the era when the manuscript culture of the European middle ages 
            transitioned into the start of printing with the 1450 invention of the printing press, to our own 
            modern era when that era of print technology is transitioning into the internet age. I have over 6 years
            of experience working with Special Collections materials at the Newberry Library, Princeton University,
            and the University of Pennsylvania, including my role as interim curator for the Furness Shakespeare Library at Penn
            Libraries. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            I hold a PhD from the University of Chicago specializing in Early Modern European Literature and Culture, 
            and my dissertation project on the description and representation of architecture in plays and poetry from
            Chaucer to Shakespeare reflected my early interest in interdisciplinary work studying the history of how 
            word and image interact in early books and manuscripts. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            For my Master's in Library and Information Science at the University of Illinois Urbaba-Champaign, I did a dual 
            specialization in special collections librarianship and data curation. This led to my work as both a 
            curator working to maintain, preserve, and grow collections of historical books and manuscripts, 
            and as a digital specialist supervising digital projects that provide creative technical solutions
            to support the description and interpretation of those historical materials, as well as making images of 
            special collections material openly available online to share with the world. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            My role as interim curator of the Furness Shakespeare Libary at 
            Penn Libraries led to me writing the successful NEH grant that launched the Philadelphia Playbills Project to crowdsource transcriptions
            and produce quality metadata for Penn's collectoin of theatrical playbills. My three years of work on the Provenance 
            Online Project (POP), which aimed to digitally crowdsource identifications of ownership marks in rare books, meant 
            provided me with the experience of working closely with a wide range of physical collection materials (largely American and European), 
            from the middle ages to the present day in collections from around the country. My work on POP included collaboration with 
            libraries both nationally and internationally to establish metadata standards for describing ownership provenance in special 
            collections and archives.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Some of my current research activities include a book in progress on the history of women's book ownership pre 1800, and
            a digital humanities project to map all the locations mentioned in Shakespeare's plays.
