            Curator and Historian
            </h3>
            <Card.Text>
            As both a librarian and a historian of books and media, I am passionate about the work of describing, maintaining, and sharing knowledge about historical books, manuscripts, and other primary resources.  I hold a Master's in Library and Information Science from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, with a dual specialization in special collections librarianship and data curation, and a PhD from the University of Chicago specializing in Early Modern European Literature and Culture. I have over 6 years of experience working with Special Collections materials at the Newberry Library, Princeton University, and the University of Pennsylvania. In these roles I worked in both traditional library and archival roles to describe, provide access to, and teach in-person sessions with library materials, and as a data curation specialist supervising digital projects that provide creative technical solutions to support the description and interpretation of historical materials and make images and information about our history available to the world.

            In addition to my curatorial work, I’ve led two major digital projects focused on the description of special collections and archives materials.  My role as interim curator of the Furness Shakespeare Library at Penn Libraries led to me writing the successful NEH grant that launched the Philadelphia Playbills Project to crowdsource transcriptions of and produce quality metadata for Penn's collection of theatrical playbills. My three years of work on the Provenance Online Project (POP), which digitally crowdsourced identifications of ownership marks in rare books, provided me with the experience of working closely with a wide range of physical collection materials (largely American and European), from the middle-ages to the present day in collections from around the country. My work on POP included collaboration with libraries both nationally and internationally to establish metadata standards for describing ownership provenance in special collections and archives.

            As a historian of books and media, I’ve been fascinated by the way information is created and expressed from my doctoral research, which focused on the role of word and image in the transitional period from manuscript to print across the late middle ages into the Renaissance, to my library work, which has focused on the way the use of images of primary sources combined text in the form of metadata and code shape how we learn on the internet today. Other current research activities include a book in progress on the history of women's book ownership and provenance marks pre-1800, and a digital humanities project to map all the locations mentioned in Shakespeare's plays.
