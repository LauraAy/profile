            <Card.Text>
            I offer 6 years of experience as a project manager with particular expertise leading projects in Libraries, Universities and Museums, 
            including the Newberry Library, the University of Pennsylvania, and Princeton University. I have taken the lead on projects that encompass 
            the building of new applications, the production of new data sets, and the digitization of rare books materials. I am familiar with popular management 
            practices such as Agile and Scrum and am practiced at both fostering communication and productive internal collaboration between developers, administrators,
             data and metadata experts, conservators, and curators. I am also experienced facilitating conversations with users and donors, building collaboration across
            multiple institutions, and writing grants.
